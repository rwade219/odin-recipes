        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4-5 large garlic cloves, minced (or 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 pounds (600 grams) large shrimp prawns, shelled with tails on or off</li>
        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine or broth</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large pan or skillet. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant (about 30 seconds - 1 minute). Then add the shrimp, season with salt and pepper to taste and sauté for 1-2 minutes on one side (until just beginning to turn pink), then flip. </li>
